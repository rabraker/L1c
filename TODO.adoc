== L1C TODOs ==

=======
. Untested functions:
.. _l1c_l1qcProb_new Should check somehow that the right things happens if malloc fails.
.. _l1c_l1qcProb_delete Dont know what to test here. I guess I can pass a null pointer, and otherwise leave it up to valgrind to check the whole thing got freed.
.. test_l1c_malloc_double_2D need to check it returns NULL if an inner malloc fails.
.. l1c_free_double_2D, should check it works when ddptr==NULL

+
. The dct/dct2 should not store their state as local-globals. This limits the user to seting up a single optimization. Rather, the state should be stored, possibly, as an opaqe  field in the struct of function pointers.
